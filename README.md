# CashCard
I'm developing this project to gain hands-on experience with the Spring Boot framework. Specifically, it is bases on the tutorial [Building a REST API with Spring Boot](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot).

## What is CashCard
CashCard is simple "Family Cash Card" application (a modern way for parents to manage allowance funds for their kiddos).

Parents often find themselves lacking an easy way to manage (i.e. send, receive, track) allowances for their kids. So instead of handing out a stack of bills, CashCard allows parents to virtually manage "cash cards" for their kiddos. You can think of the cash card being very similar to a gift card that many of us send and receive. The primary goal of the "Family Cash Card app is to give parents ease and control over managing funds for their children.

I'll use Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing the app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.

## Topics covered
- Build a REST API with Spring Boot.
- Utilize **Spring Security** to authenticate and authorize the application.
- Implement test-driven development.
- Use **Spring Data** to connect databases to Java objects.
